        question: "Can you explain the cleanup function in useEffect?",
        answer:
          " The cleanup function is returned from the effect function and is run when the component unmounts or when the effect dependencies change. Itâ€™s used to clean up subscriptions, timers, or other side effects.",

        question: "How does the useState hook work with functions?",
        answer:
          "The useState hook can accept a function that returns the initial state. This is useful when the initial state depends on a calculation or value that is expensive to compute.",

        question: "What are the limitations of React hooks?",
        answer:

        question: "What is Redux, and how does it work with React?",
        answer:

        question: "What is Reactâ€™s Virtual DOM, and how does it work?\n",
        answer: " The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM that allows React to perform efficient updates. When state or props change, React compares the Virtual DOM to the real DOM (a process called \"reconciliation\") and updates only the necessary parts.",
